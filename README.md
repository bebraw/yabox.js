# yabox.js - Yet another lightbox clone for jQuery

yabox.js makes it easy to create one of those infamous popovers. It sticks to the view center (fixed there). It is light and somewhat extensible by design.

## Installation

Add prepackaged `dist/jquery.yabox.js` to your page. There is also a minified version available.

If you want, you can install the module using Bower.

## Development

You'll need to have Node, Bower and Grunt installed. After that the following workflow should do the trick:

1. sudo npm install
2. bower install
3. grunt

The last command will run a development server.

## License

yabox.js is available under MIT. See LICENSE for more details.
